# Forgotten Key

Forgotten Key is a cross platform port of [EEKeeper](https://eekeeper.sourceforge.io/) by troodon80 which itself was built upon the work of ShadowKeeper by Aaron O'Neil in 2000. Both of these tools were designed to allow players of the Baldur's Gate series of games to edit their save files to change their characters and the world around them. That includes the Icewind Dale series, Planescape: Torment, and the Enhanced Editions of all of these games.

The goal is to provide a modern, cross platform, and open source tool for editing save files for these games. The tool is written with the Flutter framework. It is currently in a very early stage of development and is not yet ready for use. This is being developed in Linux and will be coded to be as universal as possible. It should work on Windows and Mac as well. A longer term goal would be to add support for Android and iOS as some of these games have been released on mobile platforms.

The motivation is as follows. Baldur's Gate II is my favorite game of all time. Every few years I will play through this family of games however as of late I only own Linux and Mac computers. It would be rare that I would want to edit a character but I found that instance. Initially thinking I would play a build I have never played, dual class fighter to druid, I found after earning 3 levels that I had created a character that could not be dual classed. Using EEKeeper with Wine on Linux seemed like a less than optimal solution and now I am creating this.
